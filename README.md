# Modelling-and-Verification-of-a-Vending-Machine-System-Using-UPPAAL
This project aims to model and verify a simple vending machine system using UPPAAL, a tool for modelling, simulation, and verification of real-time systems. We demonstrate simple vending machine operations. By simulating this system in UPPAAL, we demonstrate the correct operation and safety properties of the vending machine
